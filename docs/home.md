DDS came into being at the beginning of November 2019, so we're just getting setup. Don't worry, we'll add much more to this team manual as time goes on.

# Who we are

The Defence Digital Service (DDS) came into being at the beginning of November 2019. Our mission? **To pave the way for the rapid delivery of user-centred products and services in Defence**. Using modern practices and technologies we’re aiming to bring tactical and strategic advantage by responding rapidly to user needs, both in the office and the battlespace.

We're putting together a crack team of civil/crown servants along with industry experts to get the good stuff done in Defence. If you’re a veteran developer, user researcher or service designer that wants to get involved, [ping us an email](jobs@digital.mod.uk)!

Oh, and we're rather partial to a bit of Star Wars...

*Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.*

*Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.*
