# Managing delivery

Hopefully, by now, it goes without saying that we're doing doing [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) development. 

We don't prescribe to any particular methodology, as each project may need a slightly different approach. That said , the only methodologies that we explicitly don't follow are SAFe and DSDM, given their too-close-for-comfort similarity to the old way of doing things. 

As per elements of [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) and [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)), we tend to have short, sprint-like cycles, using a board that moves chunks of value to users from the left (backlog) to the right (done). We also restrict our work-in-progress (WiP) limits to increase the likelihood of rapid delivery of value to users. 

# User-centred design and other standards

Delivering services is all about the users. As such, we tend towards doing things in such a way that meets the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), using the standards set by the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). That's true for both internal, civil/crown servant facing services, as well as public-facing services.  

In terms of physical design, we take elements from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and the Royal Navy's Project NELSON's [design stadnards](https://docs.royalnavy.io/get-started).
