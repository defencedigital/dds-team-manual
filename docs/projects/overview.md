DDS projects are a mixture of military and civilian - battlespace and office space - with no restriction as to who our "customer" can be. As long as the project meets our criteria (and as long as we have time), we're game.

# How we choose projects

We have three criteria for project selection:

1. DDS must have a **senior executive sponsor**. While DDS enjoys support from the top levels of Defence, the model only works if the proposed project has a sponsor willing to be a senior advocate and remove challenges and roadblocks.
2. DDS must have the **necessary talent and skill** on the team, and be uniquely positioned to assist. An empowered and enabled team is beneficial only if they have the capabilities required to develop and deliver the project.
3. DDS involvement must have an **order-of-magnitude impact** on the MoD. Technology can accomplish so much at the hands of technical people unencumbered by the bureaucracy; our limited number of DDS personnel need to work on projects with the largest impact.

# Project types

Engagement models range in size, time and scope, and include:

1. **Rogue Squadrons:** rapid response consultations in which DDS will engage with an organisation for up to a week to dig into the technical issues an office is facing. These engagements end with a quick report or technical fix that outlines the team findings and presents possible technical paths forward. This feedback is provided to the original project sponsor to enable them to move forward.
2. **Discovery Sprints:** short to medium consultations, engaging with an organisation for up to a month to understand organisational and technical challenges and potential solutions. These engagements end with an in-depth report outlining organisational and technical paths forward for the organisation, and can potentially lead to a DDS project.
3. **DDS Projects:** these are full projects DDS has taken on to develop and deliver technology to solve a problem in the MoD. Teams are staffed according to technical needs, and the project ends with the successful transition of a technology back to the host organisation. A DDS project lasts from six months to a year depending on the technical needs of the programme.
4. **DDS Portfolios:** these reflect areas of sustained DDS engagement and include service-specific partnerships and efforts that DDS is incubating until the engagements have an appropriate home elsewhere.
